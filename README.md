# MultiResetWall

A wall-style multi-instance macro for Minecraft RSG resetting

## Instructions

A similar setup to [my normal multi-instance macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/c851a92a258dd1fdbe3eee588f3f14d8), but with a few more steps.

To start, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Specnr/MultiResetWall/releases/latest), and extract the zip into a folder. Dont move the files out of the folder,
if you need to, you can make a shortcut for TheWall.ahk and move that outside.

Update the configurable variables in the macro to match your setup. :)

Additionally, you need to make a new OBS scene with all your instances visible, and make an OBS hotkey to be F12 to switch to that scene.

## Usage

To use the macro, run TheWall.ahk and wait for it to say ready. Start up OBS, then start up a [Fullscreen projector](https://youtu.be/9YqZ6Ogv3rk).

On the Fullscreen projector, you have a few hotkeys: 
- (1-9): Will reset the instance with the corresponding number
- Shift + (1-9): Will play the instance with the corresponding number
- E: Will reset the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- R: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- F: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over, and reset all of the other ones
- T: Will reset all instances

No longer moves worlds, it slows down the macro a lot, use [this world moving macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/f7a5450d932a1277fdcd6c141ad7bf6a).
